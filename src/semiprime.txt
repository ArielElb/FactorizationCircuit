Let's create a zero-knowledge proof system for proving that a committed number is the product of two committed prime numbers. This problem is more complex and involves proving both the primality of numbers and their multiplication.

Problem Definition
We want to prove that a number 
𝑛
n is the product of two prime numbers 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q without revealing 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q. This is known as a proof of a semi-prime.

Implementation Steps
Define the Circuit:
The circuit will take witnesses 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q (the prime factors) and a public input 
𝑛
n (the number to verify) and enforce the constraints:

𝑛
=
𝑝
×
𝑞
n=p×q
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q are prime.
Generate Constraints:
Create the necessary constraints to check if 
𝑛
=
𝑝
×
𝑞
n=p×q and that 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q are prime.

Setup Phase:
Generate the proving and verifying keys.

Proving Phase:
Generate a proof that 
𝑛
n is the product of two prime numbers.

Verification Phase:
Verify the proof.
